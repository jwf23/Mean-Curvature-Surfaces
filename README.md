# Using Mean Curvature of Minimal Surface Approximations to Generate New Lattice Unit Cells

The .ntop files can be imported as custom blocks in any nTop workbook to implement the MC gyroid and MC D-surface lattices

Additional information about these nodel lattice geometries is available in our conference paper "Using Mean Curvature of Implicitly Defined Minimal Surface Approximations to Generate New Unit Cells for Lattice Design" which is available online at: <http://dx.doi.org/10.26153/tsw/44431>
